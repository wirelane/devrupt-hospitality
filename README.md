# Wirelane Devrupt Hospitality <img align="right" src="https://github.com/wirelane/devrupt-hospitality/raw/main/public/images/logo-20.png">

Wirelane <-> Apaleo integration for the [devrupt hospitality hackathon](https://www.devrupt-hospitality.com/).

## Business Case

As a hotel owner, I want my guests to be able to charge their electric vehicles (EV) regardless of any membership with electric mobility providers (EMP) or direct payment options. Guests should be able pay for the charging service together with the hotel invoice.

With the Wirelane <-> Apaleo integration, the guest can initiate a charging session by scanning the QR code at the charging station and providing the booking reference.

The hotel invoice then lists all charging sessions together with all other services consumed during the stay.

The password can be retrieved from [Bastian Konetzny](https://github.com/bkonetzny) or [Chris Bl√§ttermann](https://github.com/chrblabla).

### Demonstration

A working demonstration can be found under [https://wirelane-devrupt-hospitality.herokuapp.com](https://wirelane-devrupt-hospitality.herokuapp.com). Alternatively, the following QR code can be scanned and it directs to one of the charging stations within the demo. A valid booking number is `UZLKTPQB`.

## Technical Solution

As basis for this solution, the [apaleo/node-boilerplate](https://github.com/apaleo/node-boilerplate) is being used.  Here, the Apaleo API and the Wirelane API are being connected in order to realize the use case described above.
